# Entry 1 implementing the authentication and authorization
```
started 24/03/2023 
```
![Image Explaining the authentication system briefly](https://www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/JWT_tokens_EN.png)

Authentication will be set on a Http Post Listener that will receive a object containing the email and password of the user that will be verified in the database and that will return a JWT (Json Web Token) to the client.

The JWT will be used for authorizing all the subsequent requests.

To avoid CSRF the JWT will expire after 15 minutes.

To avoid having the client login every 15 minutes there will be a Get endpoint that refreshes the expiry of the JWT.

The JWT will contain the id, email, Role of the client.

# Entry 4 Virtual platform and Session creation and management

# Entry 5 Adding bulk insert of user data
```
started 26/03/2023 00:05
```

this is necessary as it allows the client to load multiple user data like in a csv and insert it

to achieve this it is necessary to change tactics in our query method and use query builder instead of query! macro

we use it like so: 

```rust
   sqlx::QueryBuilder::new("insert into Edl.User(email,password,role,specialty)") // creating the request 
          .push_values(users, // giving it the data source 
          |mut b,u| {  // closure detailing how to map the data 
            b.push_bind(u.email) 
              .push_bind(u.password)
              .push_bind(u.role)
              .push_bind(u.specialty);
          })
          .build()
          .execute(pool)
          .await?;
```

Note that the api receives a json array object as the csv parsing needs to be done on the client side this allows it to be more versitile on the data types it receives not just csv.

***And with that administrator apis should be done now a peer review is the next step***


# Entry 6 Adding Virtual Platform management from the Vice doyen

the vice doyen needs to:

* create and alter a session which is done with a post rest api.
* affecting applicants and monitors to a session two  post rest apis.
* make announcements to sessions one post rest api.
